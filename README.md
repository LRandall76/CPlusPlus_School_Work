Previous Code Work


The work displayed here is not all credited to me. In most of these assignments, we were given snippits of code to build on in order to accomplish an objective.
These codes were pulled from my data structures class so these assignments are based around different methods of storing and retrieving data.

Most of these assignemnts are fairly dated and not completely reflective of my work. For more recent examples, look in my Python and MATLAB repositories.
